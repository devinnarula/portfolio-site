I worked on this project with the electrical engineering department at Clemson University throughout the summer before my freshman year as a part of the 2019 EUREKA! program for honors college students. I worked with 3 other students and a graduate student to research swarm robotics and methods of localization. I created and algorithm to locate a robot relative to a sound source based on a system of 3 microphones and assisted in coding this algorithm.
